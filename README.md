# EmoInt
This repository contains the implementation of a model for Emotion Intensity Analysis along with the associated technical paper in PDF format.

Overview:
Emotion Intensity Analysis is a crucial aspect of sentiment analysis, enabling a deeper understanding of the emotional nuances embedded within textual content. The model implemented in this repository aims to predict the intensity of emotions expressed in textual data, facilitating applications in sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and affective computing.

Dataset Information:The dataset used in this project contains a total of 10,000 data points named as "datacs" However, due to resource constraints and experimental considerations, only a subset of 60 data points was utilized for model training and evaluation.
Data Subset:
Size: 60 data points
Purpose: The selected subset was chosen to represent a diverse range of examples while ensuring manageable computational requirements during experimentation.
Usage: This subset was utilized for model training, validation, and testing to assess the effectiveness and performance of the proposed approach.
Please note that the entire dataset is available for further exploration and analysis if desired.

Repository Structure:
model.ipynb: Contains the implementation of the Emotion Intensity Analysis model.
Emotion Intensity Analysis.pdf: Technical paper detailing the methodology, experiments, and findings of the Emotion Intensity Analysis model.

I have uploaded the model code in Jupyter Notebook, if you open model.ipynb by clicking on Github repository link then you can also see the visualization of graphs directly without importing or having the requirement to download.
In few model codes I have taken sample datas whereas in some I have used csv file which is uploaded named "datacs"
